##  Preamble

As a college student, it becomes easy to lose track of priorities and deadlines as the semester develops.

So, I developed this website that takes user-input to create a simple to-do list.

What makes this site unique is that it remembers tasks after the user decides to leave the session.

In other words, the site remembers your to-dos so you do not have to!

##  Getting started

I programmed these scripts using VSCode on MacOS. 

To run the scripts, make sure you are in this project's directory - '~/todo-list-site'.

Then, run the page.py script. Once active, access the page at https://localhost:5000/.

To disable the site, return to terminal and press CTRL+C.
